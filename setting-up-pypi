There are several ways to set up a pypi mirror, including bandersnatch and minirepo.  Also see pypistats (github).

--Using bandersnatch

Bandersnatch Notes

Install ubuntu 18.04  

$ sudo apt install virtualenv python3-venv python3-pip

$ mkdir mirror ; cd mirror
$ python3 -m venv venv

$ . ./venv/bin/activate

$ pip install wheel

$ pip install bandersnatch

$ sudo venv/bin/bandersnatch mirror  (generates /etc/bandersnatch.cfg)

Rerun command to sync the mirror, full size as of May 2019 was over 500G.  

----------

Use pypistats to trim it down to the popular packages.  (Haven't tried this yet).

$ pip install pypistats

----------

Another approach is to only download specific packages (and their dependencies).

$ pip install python-pypi-mirror

# Download the 'requests' package to the pypi-downloads directory:  
$ pypi-mirror -d pypi-downloads download requests  

# Now create the pypi mirror in the 'mirror' directory:
$ pypi-mirror -d pypi-packages create -m mirror  

# Quick and dirty python http server:  

$ python3 -m http.server  

# It will start a HTTP server that will serve file from the current directory (which should contains the downloads directory and the simple directory). You can then install packages using your brand new mirror using the following command:  

$ pip install -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/simple requests
